MVC Semester 1 Project - Predicting Performance of any Basketball Player
In this project, I aim to project any basketball player's performance using concepts of MVC such as partial derivatives. Using real-world data from sources, such as ESPN and the official website of the NBA, this allows me to produce a model to predict a player's performance with some variables, such as shooting %s, assists, rebounds, altitude, and home court advantage. I decided to use two different styles of models: linear-regression model(closed-form) and gradient descent model. I use these models then to see how well they actually predict the player's performance and which model is supposedly "better". Also, the partial derivatives underneath the performance signifies the impact of each variable onto the model.
